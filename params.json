{"name":"Rth","tagline":"Parallel R through Thrust","body":"###What is this?\r\n\r\nRth is a package of functions written in Thrust, callable from R. It thus \r\nprovides to R programmers a set of parallel applications that run on both GPUs \r\nand multicore systems\r\n\r\nThrust is a C++ package for parallel processing. It was originally designed as \r\na high-level approach to GPU programming, but actually can be compiled to \r\nmultiple backends--GPUs (CUDA) and multicore (OpenMP, TBB). This ability to \r\nhave the same parallel code run on both GPU and multicore systems is extremely \r\nvaluable. (You need not have a GPU to run the multicore backends.) \r\n\r\nOperations are high-level, such as sorting, selecting, searching and prefix \r\nscan. From these basic building blocks, a myriad of parallel applications can \r\nbe coded.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider Rth's rthorder(), which (in one of its options) serves as \r\na parallel version of R's rank(). It first calls Thrust's sort_by_key() \r\nfunction, and then uses Thrust's scatter() function to permute the results in a \r\nway that produces the proper ranks.\r\n\r\nR programmers can use Rth without knowing C++, Thrust, OpenMP or CUDA! But those \r\nwho do know C++/Thrust can easily develop their own apps using the Rth approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Pretty Good Parallelism\r\n\r\nThe Pretty Good Privacy package (PGP) gave the world encryption which, though \r\nnot optimal, was simple to use and readily available. With Rth, the idea is to \r\nhave PGP mean \"pretty good parallelism\"--not necessarily optimal, but easy to \r\ndevelop and with the key virtue that the same code gives reasonably good \r\nperformance on both GPUs and multicore.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Platform requirements\r\n\r\nTo build the package, you will need to have the correct build environment set\r\nup.  Exactly what that means depends on whether you wish to build rth for use\r\nwith a gpu or multicore.\r\n\r\nIf you have a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU, you will need the nvcc compiler and CUDA \r\ndevelopment package.\r\n\r\nFor the multicore case, you will need a C++ compiler with an OpenMP library \r\n(this excludes clang++ at the time of writing).  GNU g++ should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
